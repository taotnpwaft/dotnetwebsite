# dotnetwebsite

This is a .NET Core built (netcoreapp3.1) website that was created by @idormain for our website.   

This potentially could be used as the website with some modifications.  Someone with more C# and .NET experience could build this website.  

It potentially needs some refactoring and restructuring.  

Included .vs and .vscode folders with reccomended settings and reccomended extensions for C# and .NET development.
